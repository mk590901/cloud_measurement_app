# Measuring In Cloud

Flutter frontend for cloud located sensor.

## Introduction

>The goal of the project is to developing a universal widget for controlling and visualizing a certain virtual (for now) measuring instrument. In this case - this is a temperature sensor.

## Concept

>The widget is a tile consisting of several elements: an icon with animation elements, a measurement result field and a button that allows you to initiate or interrupt a measurement. The color of the widget changes depending on the received measuring value: out of range, critically low, low, normal, and then increasing according to the same principle. The main idea is to create a common measuring panel for a certain number of sensors in the form of a vertical list of items, each of which is a widget of a separate device or a property of a complex device.

## Implementation

>All application elements were created earlier and applied in the project https://github.com/mk590901/temperature_sensor_simulator. In the current project they are just a little more streamlined and refactored. The implementation still uses the BLOC model.
